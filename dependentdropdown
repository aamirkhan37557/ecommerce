here we will work on three depended select box 

//install vue js and run npm watch

// create all the constrained for them 

//after create constraint primary foreign key create route for them so i had done crud on all of them so i create
3 different routes for them 

Route::resource('Categories','CategoryController');

Route::resource('Sub_Category','SubCategoryController');

Route::resource('Subsubcat','SubsubcatController');

//now i will create api mean i will get json data of all these





//controller for sub category id inside its controller
//we pass model name for model route binding because we want to find it according to id

  public function show(Sub_Category $Sub_Category)
    {
        return Response()->json($Sub_Category);
    }



//controller for sub sub category id inside its controller
//we pass model name for model route binding because we want to find it according to id 
   public function show(Subsubcat $Subsubcat)
    {
        return Response()->json($Subsubcat);
    }
    
   //now check in route either its working according to id exsist in database or not
   
   //now switch to vue js copy and paster all the code of all selected box which we want to be depended in vuejs components and check it 
   
             //now first we will display the categories for it  add this 
             
              <select  name="category" v-model='category' @change='getsubcategory()'>  
              
              //as we pass we model so in data return make this    category:0, in return 
              
              //now pass this function to mounted to load automatically  this.getcategory(),
              
              //now create the function to get the data from the controller using axios
